# PDFto4BC

A tool to convert .PDF documents to a paginated four-bit depth packed-pixel run-length encoded format. Allows for optional cropping and scales to a specified target display's dimensions. The "4bc" format is intended to be easily parsed and decompressed a page at a time by low-power small memory devices (microcontrollers) and to provide reasonable compression. Created for a DIY e-reader project based on an ESP32 and WaveShare e-ink display (1404x1872, four-bit per pixel).
